# Board Exam Management System

## Abstract

This project aims to help examiners conduct CBSE board exams more smoothly by offering a system where they can store and evaluate a student’s answer sheets. The board allocates examiners for answer sheet valuation. The details of the examiners such as examiner name, examiner’s school, qualification, subject etc are maintained. An examiner evaluates many answer sheets each identified by answer book id, student_roll_number, mark assigned etc. An answer sheet is evaluated by only one examiner. An examiner is also allocated to a school for invigilation. A school has many examiners as invigilators. A school is identified by school id, school name and location.
The examiner enters the student details and marks assigned in the exam table. The student enters their details and registers for the exam. The State Head Examiner can edit and enter the state examination centers where the examiners will be assigned to each school. The Central Head Examiner can access all the centres and state head examiners of the country. After the paper checking process, the marks are returned to the online portal by the examiner where the students can access it.
